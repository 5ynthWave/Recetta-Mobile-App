    UI looks solid, though the title is just a stylistic choice, it should be
      uppercased rather than lowercased

James Riley
  Claims Analysis
    Claim 1
      Categories SHOULD be highlighted when selected, people have short
      attention spans to remember what they highlighted (selected)
    Claim 2
      Text should be separated into bullet points
      Instructions are easier to follow when they are separated rather than following a
        wall of text

  Notes
    Navigation bar should be changed to fit the format of a browser (put on top)

Notes to self
  Highlight selected categories
  Hamburger menu icons should be changed as they are misleading and confuse the
    user to think that they are pressables with menus
  Cookware and kitchenware is missing
  Instruction section is poor
