      uppercased rather than lowercased

  Claims Analysis
    Claim 1
      Categories SHOULD be highlighted when selected, people have short
      attention spans to remember what they highlighted (selected)
    Claim 2
      Text should be separated into bullet points
      Instructions are easier to follow when they are separated rather than following a
        wall of text

  Notes
    Navigation bar should be changed to fit the format of a browser (put on top)

Notes to self
  Hamburger menu icons should be changed as they are misleading and confuse the
    user to think that they are pressables with menus
